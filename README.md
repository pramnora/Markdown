A much simpler way than HTML to MarkUp text files whilst creating them on the *fly*...using just simply the computer keyboard.

2. The Markdown language is very quick, simple and easy to learn. 
3. Using appropriate software, Markdown files can be translated into becoming either: (.html)/(.pdf)/-etc.
