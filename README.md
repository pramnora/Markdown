#Markdown

A much simpler way than HTML to MarkUp text files whilst creating them on the *fly*...using just simply the computer keyboard. 

##Introduction

1. Markdown language files consist of just merely plain text. 
2. The Markdown language is very quick, simple and easy to learn. 
3. Using appropriate software, Markdown files can be translated into becoming either: (.html)/(.pdf)/-etc.
