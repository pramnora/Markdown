#Markdown

A much simpler way to MarkUp text files whilst creating them on the fly...using just simply the computer keyboard. 

##Introduction

Markdown language files use plain text. The Markdown language is simple, quick and easy to learn. The files can also be, later on, translated to become either (.html)/(.pdf)/-etc.

##Links

Here are a few sites where it's possible to go to learn more; and, even practice learning how to use Markdown syntax online inside of the web browser itself.
